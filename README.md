# Signup

This is a simple web application that contains only the signup page using angular CLI version 1.0.0.In this application, the email field is validated and the submit button is disable until user enter the right format email and password. There is also a feature to ensure the typo mistake of email. For example, if user enter "user@gnail.com", the application will suggest that "Do you mean user@gmail.com". If user enter "usergmail.com", the application will suggest "Do you mean user@gmail.com". From my point of view, auto correction of email doesn't really provide good user experience and it may irriate user instead. However, suggesting email and give user a choice to correct is a better option.
